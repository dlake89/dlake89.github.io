                <h3>Leadership</h3>
                <p>No matter what the topic is professional or casual, I am always finding a relational topic to get to know what people know how to do best. With that you can lead anyone anywhere.</p>

                <h3>Ideas</h3>
                <p>Anyone who knows me will tell you that I am full of ideas. I love helping people accomplish a task that I can stand proudly behind and say that I had a part in that.</p>

                <h3>Code</h3>
                <p>I love to learn new things about new languages and tools that make life faster, easier, and more enjoyable. If there is a repetative task most likely you will find me creating a tool to resolve that issue.</p>
